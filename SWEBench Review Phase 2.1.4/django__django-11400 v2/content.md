   The test fails because an equality comparison failed for the `get_choices()` method. The order of items returned did not match the expected order.

  The test fails because an equality comparison failed for the `get_choices()` method. The order of items returned did not match the expected order.

The above tests fails because the model provides only a partial solution to the problem. It was supposed to update the `get_choices()` method in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` to also respect the `default_ordering` attribute of the model. However, it only updates the `field_choices()` methods in the `RelatedFieldListFilter` and `RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter` filters in `django/contrib/admin/filters.py`.
