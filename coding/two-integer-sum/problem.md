Two Sum
=======

Easy

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices `i` and `j` such that `nums[i] + nums[j] == target` and `i != j`.

You may assume that _every_ input has exactly one pair of indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

**Example 1:**

    Input: 
    nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7
    
    Output: [0,1]
    

Copy

Explanation: `nums[0] + nums[1] == 7`, so we return `[0, 1]`.

**Example 2:**

    Input: nums = [4,5,6], target = 10
    
    Output: [0,2]
    

Copy

**Example 3:**

    Input: nums = [5,5], target = 10
    
    Output: [0,1]
    

Copy

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `-10,000,000 <= nums[i] <= 10,000,000`
* `-10,000,000 <= target <= 10,000,000`

Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with `O(n)` time and `O(n)` space, where n is the size of the input array.

Hint 1

A brute force solution would be to check every pair of numbers in the array. This would be an `O(n^2)` solution. Can you think of a better way? Maybe in terms of mathematical equation?

Hint 2

Given, We need to find indices `i` and `j` such that `i != j` and `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`. Can you rearrange the equation and try to fix any index to iterate on?

Hint 3

we can iterate through nums with index `i`. Let `difference = target - nums[i]` and check if `difference` exists in the hash map as we iterate through the array, else store the current element in the hashmap with its index and continue. We use a hashmap for `O(1)` lookups.
