Top K Frequent Elements
=======================

Medium

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements within the array.

The test cases are generated such that the answer is always **unique**.

You may return the output in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

    Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3], k = 2
    
    Output: [2,3]
    

Copy

**Example 2:**

    Input: nums = [7,7], k = 1
    
    Output: [7]
    

Copy

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`.
* `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
* `1 <= k <= number of distinct elements in nums`.

Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with `O(n)` time and `O(n)` space, where `n` is the size of the input array.

Hint 1

A naive solution would be to count the frequency of each number and then sort the array based on each elementâ€™s frequency. After that, we would select the top `k` frequent elements. This would be an `O(nlogn)` solution. Though this solution is acceptable, can you think of a better way?

Hint 2

Can you think of an algorithm which involves grouping numbers based on their frequency?

Hint 3

Use the bucket sort algorithm to create `n` buckets, grouping numbers based on their frequencies from `1` to `n`. Then, pick the top `k` numbers from the buckets, starting from `n` down to `1`.
